Sunless Sea: Rewritten
	by Nonagon (and others)
	
	
***Overview***

Sunless Sea: Rewritten is a massive undertaking to completely rewrite Sunless Sea from the ground up. Every port, every officer, every story is completely rebuilt, creating an entirely new Sunless Sea experience.


***Installation***

**To install the game files:** Find the relevant files at User/appdata/LocalLow/Failbetter Games/Sunless Sea. Before making any changes, either manually save in-game (which will cost you your Invictus Token) or go into the Saves folder and backup autosave.json somewhere safe. Then, head to the addon folder and copy the entire Sunless Sea Rewritten folder and all its subfolders into it. Be aware that due to changes to the map, starting a new game is required to prevent glitches.

Warning! Adding mods is easy, but removing them is another matter. Once a game has been saved with modded files, that save will no longer function if those files are removed. To remove Sunless Sea: Rewritten, delete the Sunless Sea: Rewritten folder from the Addons folder and revert back to your old save file. Additionally, be aware that not all mods will play nicely together.

**To install images:** Back out of the addon folder and enter images, then sn, then icons. Copy all of the image files in the provided SSR Images folder into this folder.

**To install music:** This one is a little more involved and requires an external download. Don't worry, I'll walk you through it.

First, download a stable version of the Unity Assets Bundle Extractor, found here: https://forums.7daystodie.com/forum/-7-days-to-die-pc/game-modification/tools/23262-unity-assets-bundle-extractor?22675-Unity-Assets-Bundle-Extractor=

Next, navigate to the Sunless Sea program files, most likely located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SunlessSea\Sunless Sea_Data. Before doing anything else, create a new folder called Backup and copy the resources.assets file into it.

In a separate window, open the provided SSR Music folder. Copy the SSR_Music.resource file into the Sunless Sea Data folder.

Open the Unity Assets Bundle Extractor. Using the UABE, open the globalgamemanagers file in the Sunless Sea Data folder - the regular one, NOT the .assets one.

Click View > Search by name, and search for one of the names of the text files in the SSR Music folder. Select the file that you're navigated to and click Import Dump, then import the text file of the same name. This will tell the game where to find the music file and when to stop and start it. Repeat this process for each text file.

Click OK. You can't overwrite files with the UABE, so save your new .assets file under a unique name. Once it's saved, delete resources.assets and rename your new file to resources.assets.

Celebrate with cake and wine.

To uninstall the music: Delete the modified resources.assets file and replace it with your backed-up copy.
